VoteAleo: A User's Perspective

As a user, your experience with VoteAleo will be seamless, secure, and private, whether you're a voter, campaign creator, or part of a decentralized organization (DAO). Here's what your journey might look like across different phases and interactions.

1. Campaign Creation (For Campaign Creators)

Scenario: You want to create a governance poll for your community or run an election for a DAO decision.

Step 1: Start a Campaign

You log in with your Aleo wallet (secure, privacy-focused, and anonymous).

You choose to create a new campaign and enter a title (e.g., "Vote for New DAO Proposal"), a description (e.g., "Help decide whether we should fund the new marketing initiative"), and set a voting period (e.g., from January 20th to January 30th).

Step 2: Define Voting Options

You specify voting options like "Yes" or "No" or add more detailed choices if needed (e.g., Option 1: Approve, Option 2: Reject, Option 3: Abstain).

You could even use AI suggestions for better campaign options, like using AI to propose additional questions or suggestions based on the campaign’s theme.

Step 3: Set Privacy & Access

You can choose whether the voting will be public or private. For private campaigns, you might decide to whitelist eligible voters (for example, only wallet addresses associated with verified DAO members).

You upload a campaign image (stored on IPFS) to make it visually appealing.

Step 4: Launch Campaign

After finalizing all settings, you schedule the voting to begin on the date you set and hit Launch. Once launched, voters can cast their votes anonymously.

2. Voting (For Voters)

Scenario: You're a voter in a DAO or a community election, and you want to cast your vote securely and privately.

Step 1: Join the Voting Campaign

You receive an invitation link or an alert via the DAO governance platform (or email) notifying you of an ongoing vote.

You log in to VoteAleo using your Aleo wallet, and the platform confirms your eligibility to vote (e.g., if you’re part of the whitelist or meet certain criteria).

Step 2: Browse Campaigns

You browse the active campaigns and find the one you are eligible to participate in.

You read the campaign title and description to understand the vote’s context (e.g., a governance proposal or a community poll).

Step 3: Cast Your Vote

You choose your vote option (e.g., Yes/No, multiple candidates, or even rank preferences).

When casting your vote, you can opt to leave a private comment explaining your choice, but it’s not required. Your comment, if submitted, will be encrypted to ensure privacy.

You sign the transaction using your Aleo wallet. No gas fees are involved for you; the relayer pays the transaction cost.

Step 4: Confirm Your Vote

Once you confirm, your vote is submitted and recorded on the blockchain. The system ensures that your vote is private, and no one can trace your choice back to you (this is done using Aleo's zk-SNARKs).

Step 5: Track Results (Optional)

You can track the campaign progress (though the results remain hidden) until the end of the voting period. Once voting ends, the results are revealed (anonymously) to everyone, showing the aggregated votes but preserving individual privacy.

3. Campaign Results (For Campaign Creators & Voters)

Scenario: The voting period has ended, and you want to see the results of your campaign.

Step 1: Viewing Results

As the campaign creator, you can access the final vote tally for your campaign, including an aggregated breakdown of votes (e.g., how many votes each option received).

If the campaign was private, only invited voters will be able to view the results, and these results are displayed in a privacy-preserving way.

Step 2: Voter Analytics & Insights (For Creators)

As a creator, you can view analytics, such as voter engagement and voter behavior trends, without seeing who voted for what. For example, you might see the total number of votes and how they were distributed across options.

You can access detailed data such as voter participation rates and general sentiment (e.g., percentage of voters who supported the proposal).

Step 3: Post-Vote Accountability

As a voter, you can choose to prove that you participated in the vote without revealing what your vote was. For example, you can share a proof of participation but remain anonymous regarding your actual vote choice.

This is a feature particularly useful for those who want to maintain transparency but preserve privacy (e.g., in sensitive political elections).

4. Gamification & Rewards (For Active Participants)

Scenario: You’re an active participant in the voting system and want to earn rewards for your engagement.

Step 1: Earning Reputation

Each time you participate in a campaign (whether by voting or commenting), you earn reputation points or tokens.

These reputation points could be used for future participation in governance, or you might receive rewards like tokens or access to exclusive campaigns.

Step 2: Rewards for Engagement

If you actively share campaigns, help with campaign promotion, or participate in a voting contest, you could earn additional rewards.

As your reputation grows, you may gain more influence in future votes or even be eligible for special voting privileges in DAOs or community-driven decisions.

5. Special Features (For Advanced Users)

Cross-Chain Participation:

If you’re using multiple blockchain platforms (e.g., Ethereum, Solana), you can cast your vote across different chains, but still maintain full privacy and security, thanks to Aleo’s cross-chain capabilities.

Conditional Voting (For Special Elections):

Some campaigns allow conditional voting, where your vote is part of a multi-phase decision-making process. For example, you might vote on a funding proposal, and depending on the result of that vote, a new vote could open for a follow-up proposal (automatically triggered based on the first vote outcome).

Private Campaigns:

You can join invitation-only private campaigns and vote securely without worrying about being seen by others. Your vote remains encrypted and private, even from the campaign creator.

Conclusion:

From creating campaigns and casting anonymous votes to tracking results and earning rewards, the VoteAleo platform is designed to offer a fully private, secure, and user-friendly experience. Whether you're a campaign creator or a voter, your privacy is always guaranteed, and your voting choices remain anonymous.
